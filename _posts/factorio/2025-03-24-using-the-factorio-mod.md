The [Randovania mod in Factorio's mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/randovania) is just a companion to the main Randovania application, which can be downloaded from [here](https://randovania.org/download/).

## How to configure the mod

Note: These instructions skip optional configuration steps for brevity.

1. Download the Randovania application from [here](https://randovania.org/download/).

2. Open the application, go to Games, select Factorio.

3. Click "Quick Generate".
    
    a. Wait for it to finish.

4. In the newly opened window, click "Export Game".
