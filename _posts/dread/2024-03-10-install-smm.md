Randovania recommends use of SimpleModManager when playing randomizers on Switch.

Start by downloading the latest release of SimpleModManager here: <https://github.com/nadrino/SimpleModManager/releases>

Copy it to the `atmosphere` folder on your SD card (or wherever you install homebrew apps) and launch the application.

Select Metroid Dread from the games list. **You must export a game in Randovania before Dread will appear in the games list!**

All of your randomized games will be displayed here. You may have multiple randomized games on your Switch, but be careful: *only one can be active at a time*. Ensure that you deactivate any old games before activating a new one.

Choose the game you want to activate, and press A to apply. You can also deactivate any old games by choosing them and pressing X.

When you see **Active** on exactly one game, everything is finished and you're ready to launch the game and play.
