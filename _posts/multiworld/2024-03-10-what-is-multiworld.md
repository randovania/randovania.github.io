## Multiworld

Multiworld is a game mode for the randomizer where multiple games and/or multiple players can come together to create a larger experience.

In a Multiworld session, there exist different Worlds. A player can join as many Worlds as they like. Each World is filled with items destined for a specific World - this may be one of your own Worlds, or another player's World. When a player collects an item for a World, it's instantly delivered to the destination World, so that the player can use it right away.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I play multiworld?

In the "Multiworld" tab, either join an existing session or host a new one. Create a new World with a game and preset, or claim an already existing one, and then generate a game. Double check if the presets are correct and then start the session. Then in the "Session and Connectivity" tab, add a connection method so that Randovania can connect to the game (for example, Dolphin for the Prime games).

Each player exports their own game, plays it and keeps Randovania open during gameplay to maintain the connection to the session.

#### How do I send an item to someone else?

Certain items in your game will belong to some other World. After you collect one of these items, it will be automatically sent to that World and you'll receive an alert that it was sent.

You must make sure that Randovania is connected to the game. The "History" tab in the "Session" window can be used to confirm the item was detected and sent correctly.

#### What happens if I die, reload a save or crash?

All received items you've lost are automatically re-delivered. Collecting an item that you've already sent to someone else has no effect and is perfectly safe.

#### What happens if I disconnect from the server?

Randovania keeps track of everything you've collected and will send that information to the server as soon as it regains connection, even if it's restarted.

#### Do all players have to play at the same time?

No. All comunication between players is managed by the Randovania server.

#### Can different games be mixed in a session?

Yes. Items for another game will appear via an equivalent model for your game, or the generic model.

Some games also provide the option of using specific models. For the Prime games, you can provide a copy of another Prime game during the game exporting process to use the correct models from the other game.

#### Can I play multiple games alone?

Yes. Just create multiple worlds and claim them all for yourself.

#### How many players can play at the same time?

While there are no hard limits, there has been little testing with over 30 players or worlds.

If planning a larger session, please make contact in the Randovania Discord.
