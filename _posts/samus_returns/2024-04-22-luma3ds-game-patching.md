You should already have Luma3DS installed on your SD Card, but if not, you can download the latest release here: https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases

Once you have the randomizer files and Luma3DS on your SD Card in the proper folders, open Luma3DS by holding SELECT when turning on your 3DS. Check **Enable game patching** to apply the mod.

Once it is enabled, save and return to the Home Menu, then launch the game. To disable the mod, re-enter the Luma3DS menu and check the option.
