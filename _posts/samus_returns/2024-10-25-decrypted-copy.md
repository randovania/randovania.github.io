Using Godmode9 from your 3DS, you can dump a decrypted copy of the game. This guide will ensure you get a proper dump either as a `.3ds` or `.cxi` file.

## Game Cartridge

If you're using the NTSC version, navigate to `[C:] GAMECART` -> `00040000001BB200_v00.trim.3ds`.

If you're using the PAL version, navigate to `[C:] GAMECART` -> `00040000001BFB00_v00.trim.3ds`.

Next, navigate to `NCSD image options...` -> `Decrypt file (0:/gm9/out)`, then press A to confirm. 

Copy the `.3ds` file from this directory on the SD Card to some place on your computer.
