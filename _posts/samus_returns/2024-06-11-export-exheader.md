You can either extract your ExHeader using Godmode9 from your 3DS, or by using [ctrtool](https://github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR/releases/tag/ctrtool-v1.2.0) or [pyctr](https://github.com/ihaveamac/pyctr) on your computer. We'll show you how to do it using Godmode9.

## Game Installed on SD Card

If you're using the NTSC version, navigate to **[A:] SYSNAND SD -> title -> 00040000 -> 001bb200 -> content -> 00000000.tmd**.

If you're using the PAL version, navigate to **[A:] SYSNAND SD -> title -> 00040000 -> 001bfb00 -> content -> 00000000.tmd**.

Next, navigate to **TMD file options... -> Mount CXI/NDA to drive**, then press A to confirm.

Highlight the **extheader.bin** file, and press A while holding R to open another menu. From here, select **Copy to 0:/gm9/out**. Copy the extracted extheader.bin file from this directory on the SD Card to some place on your computer.
