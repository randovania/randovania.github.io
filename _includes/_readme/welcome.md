Randovania can randomize many aspects of its supported games, all while still ensuring they're completable 
without using any glitches or exploits. Its features include:

* Randomizing what can be found in each item location. Weapons, keys, and more can end up in
  completely new places.

* Use Multiworld sessions to shuffle items between multiple separate games, alone or with friends.
  All Multiworld games are compatible with each other - mix and match as you like!

* Randomize how areas connect to one another, or what resources are required to travel between areas.
  These options are highly customizable, letting you limit or unleash the chaos.

* Randomize your starting equipment and location. Feeling brave? You can even shuffle items
  you normally start with.

Have fun and start randomizing!
