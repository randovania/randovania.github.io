faq:
- question: What patcher does Randovania use?
  answer: Randovania supports the open source patcher MARS (Metroid Advance 
    Randomizer System). This is a new patcher built from scratch and is 
    unrelated to other Fusion Randomizers. Any differences from the vanilla game
    are covered under the differences tab.
- question: Which versions of Fusion are supported?
  answer: Only the USA version of Fusion is supported with no current plans to 
    support additional versions.
- question: I saved in a place I can't get out of, am I softlocked?
  answer: You can use the "Warp to Start" function in the pause menu by pressing
    L and confirming. This will place you back at your start location with 
    everything collected since your last save. Please note that this is never 
    logical.
- question: What is required to trigger and fight the SA-X?
  answer: "To trigger the SA-X fight, you must have collected enough Infant Metroids
    and approach the Operations Room hatch. To fight the SA-X you will require Charge
    Beam and Missiles.\nReminder that the Operations Room hatch is now a grey Level
    0 hatch."

    of effects and damage.\n- Missile Launcher Data - Allows Samus to fire missiles
    causing 10 damage with no other upgrades\n- Super Missile Data - Adds 20 damage\n\
    - Ice Missile Data - Adds the ability to freeze enemies with direct hits and adds
    10 damage\n- Diffusion Missile Data - Adds the ability to charge a freezing blast

    \nEach beam collected adds to the total damage dealt per projectile."
- question: How do the Suit Upgrades interact?
  answer: "The suit upgrades have been split, allowing unique combinations of effects
    and damage reduction.\n- Varia Suit - Adds protection from heated and cold rooms,
    and the ability to absorb Blue-X\n- Gravity Suit - Adds the ability to freely
    move in liquids\n\nEach suit collected provides additional damage reduction (amount
    depending on enemy type).\nBoth suits are required for immunity to lava."
