faq:
- question: What patcher does Randovania use?
  answer: Randovania supports the open source patcher MARS (Metroid Advance Randomizer
    System). This is a new patcher built from scratch and is unrelated to other Fusion
    Randomizers. Any differences from the vanilla game are covered under the differences
    tab.
- question: Which versions of Fusion are supported?
  answer: Only the USA version of Fusion is supported with no current plans to support
    additional versions.
- question: I saved in a place I can't get out of, am I softlocked?
  answer: You can use the "Warp to Start" function in the pause menu by pressing L
    and confirming. This will place you back at your start location with everything
    collected since your last save. Please note that this is never logical.
- question: What is required to trigger and fight the SA-X?
  answer: "To trigger the SA-X fight, you must have collected enough Infant Metroids
    and approach the Operations Room hatch. To fight the SA-X you will require Charge
    Beam and Missiles.\nReminder that the Operations Room hatch is now a grey Level
    0 hatch."
