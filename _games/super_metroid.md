faq:
- question: What glitches are accounted for in logic?
  answer: Mostly none at the moment. There are a few, but this is a work in progress.
    Once implemented, players will be able to enable or disable any category of tricks
    by setting a difficulty for each trick category in the preset.
- question: How do I adjust heatrun logic?
  answer: There is no heatrun logic, but when that's added you will be able to set
    a scale for how much health you're expected to have to perform heat runs, as well
    as setting a trick difficulty that can outright disable more complex ones. This
    is not yet a feature.
- question: What version of the game should I play on?
  answer: The NTSC version is what you should use. NTSC-U and NTSC-J are actually
    identical, so it doesn't matter which you use. The PAL version is not supported.
- question: What can be randomized?
  answer: You can randomize the game's items, as well as starting items and spawn
    location. You can only spawn in Vanilla save stations, at the ship, or at Ceres
    Station. Item rando can be done as either major/minor or full rando. You cannot
    randomize room or area layout, door caps, bosses, escape, or anything else, though
    these are planned for the future.
- question: What patches are supported?
  answer: There are many patches, both gameplay patches (which can be selected in
    the preset settings) and cosmetic patches (which can be chosen in the cosmetic
    patches dialogue after generating a game). There is no support for custom Samus
    or Ship sprites at the moment, though this is planned for future.
- question: Will you support multiworld?
  answer: This is planned in future. Much of the work on the game interface has already
    been done, but there's more work that needs to be done to integrate the game with
    Randovania.
- question: Will you support SMZ3?
  answer: No.
