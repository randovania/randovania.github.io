faq:
- question: I can't use this spider track, even though I have Spider Ball!
  answer: "The following rooms have surprising vanilla behaviour about their spider
    tracks:\n\n#### Main Reactor (Agon Wastes)\n\nThe spider tracks only works after
    you beat Dark Samus 1 and reload the room. When playing with no tricks, this means
    you need Dark Beam to escape the room.\n\n#### Dynamo Works (Sanctuary Fortress)\n
    \nThe spider tracks only works after you beat Spider Guardian. When playing with
    no tricks, you can't leave this way until you do that.\n\n#### Spider Guardian
    fight (Sanctuary Fortress)\n\nDuring the fight, the spider tracks only works in
    the first and last phases. After the fight, they all work normally.\nThis means
    you need Boost Ball to fight Spider Guardian."

    Visor?

    echo locks to appear.
