faq:
- question: I can't use this spider track, even though I have Spider Ball!
  answer: "The following rooms have surprising vanilla behaviour about their spider
    tracks:\n\n#### Main Reactor (Agon Wastes)\n\nThe spider tracks only works after
    you beat Dark Samus 1 and reload the room. When playing with no tricks, this means
    you need Dark Beam to escape the room.\n\n#### Dynamo Works (Sanctuary Fortress)\n
    \nThe spider tracks only works after you beat Spider Guardian. When playing with
    no tricks, you can't leave this way until you do that.\n\n#### Spider Guardian
    fight (Sanctuary Fortress)\n\nDuring the fight, the spider tracks only works in
    the first and last phases. After the fight, they all work normally.\nThis means
    you need Boost Ball to fight Spider Guardian."

    Energy Controller.
- question: Why can't I see the echo locks in Mining Plaza even when using the Echo
    Visor?
  answer: You need to beat Amorbis and then return the Agon Energy in order for these
    echo locks to appear.
- question: Why can't I cross the door between Underground Transport and Torvus Temple?
  answer: The energy gate that disappears after the pirate fight in Torvus Temple
    blocks this door.
- question: Why can't I use the Kinetic Orb Cannon in Sanctuary Entrance?
  answer: The morph cannon will only be active once the scan post has been scanned
    and the room has been reloaded.
- question: How do I use the light beam transports?
  answer: "To use a light beam transport, simply enter the light beams/holograms with
    Light Suit. The following rooms behave differently and do not require Light Suit,
    and may have additional requirements in order to use the transports:\n\n#### Energy
    Controllers\nThe light beam transports that are unlocked upon returning the Sanctuary
    Energy and going back to Main Energy Controller.\n\n#### Sky Temple Gateway (Sky
    Temple Grounds)\n\nThe light beam transport unlocked when returning all the Sky
    Temple Keys.\n\n#### Sky Temple Energy Controller (Sky Temple)\n\nTaking the transport
    hologram at the center of this room."
