faq:
- question: AM2R already has a built-in randomizer, what does this do differently?
  answer: "The Randovania implementation provides additional robustness and more features
    compared to the built-in randomizer.\n\nKey features supported by Randovania include,
    but are not limited to, full item logic, toggleable tricks and difficulties, Door
    Lock Rando, and Multiworld support.\n\nAll Metroids now also drop items. This
    can include progression, expansions, or DNA. DNA are like keys and are used to
    enter the path to the Queen. The amount of DNA is configurable and a hint system
    has been implemented, which means it's not necessary anymore to fight all the
    Metroids."
- question: Which versions of AM2R are supported?
  answer: Only version 1.5.5 is supported. Currently there are no plans to support
    other versions.
- question: Why can I not fire Missiles / Super Missiles / Power Bombs?
  answer: You likely have the 'Required Mains' option enabled. This means you first
    need to find the Launcher for your Missiles / Super Missiles / Power Bombs before
    you can use them.
- question: Why was the DNA goal chosen, and why does the Starter Preset require main
    items / launchers for Missiles / Super Missiles / Power Bombs?
  answer: "Both were chosen to provide better gameplay and more variety. Killing the
    same 46 Metroids over and over again is not only tedious, but also boring. The
    Metroids dropping items makes Metroid fights interesting and worthwhile to do
    as opposed to most players otherwise just ignoring them entirely, while also not
    making it mandatory to kill all Metroids.\nRequired mains / launchers causes progression
    to be more natural, as otherwise it's possible to break the logic chain and get
    overpowered by just finding ammo early."
- question: I saved in a place that I can't get out of, what do I do?
  answer: You can use the 'Restart from Start Location' option, which will reload
    your last save but make you spawn at the original start location.
- question: What causes Serris to spawn?
  answer: Serris will spawn once you collect the item in Distribution Center - Ice
    Beam Chamber and then hit the fight trigger on the left side of the Serris Arena.
- question: Can I defeat Serris without Ice Beam?
  answer: Yes, Serris automatically changes her weakness to not require Ice Beam if
    you fight her before acquiring it.
- question: Where can I find the Hints?
  answer: "There are eight hints in total, and the map will show an 'H' icon on places
    where hints exist. They can can be found in:\n\n- Main Caves - Research Site Elevator\n\
    - Golden Temple - Breeding Grounds Hub\n- Hydro Station - Breeding Grounds Lobby\n\
    - Industrial Complex - Breeding Grounds Fly Stadium\n- The Tower - Tower Exterior
    North\n- Distribution Center - Distribution Facility Tower East\n- The Depths
    - Bubble Lair Shinespark Cave\n- Genetics Laboratory - Destroyed Chozo Memorial"
- question: What are shinies?
  answer: "Some items have a 1 in 1024 chance of being a Pok\xE9mon-style shiny: they
    look different but behave entirely the same as normal. In a multiworld game, only
    your own items can be shiny."
